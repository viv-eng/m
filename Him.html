  IS MATTER AROUND US PURE?
  Chapter
  2020-21<br>Fig. 2.1: Some consumable items
  Have you ever noticed the word ‘pure’
  written on the packs of these consumables?<br>
  For a common person pure means having no
  adulteration. But, for a scientist all these things
  are actually mixtures of different substances
  and hence not pure. For example, milk is
  actually a mixture of water, fat, proteins etc.
  When a scientist says that something is pure,
  it means that all the constituent particles of
  that substance are the same in their chemical
  nature. A pure substance consists of a single
  type of particles. In other words, a substance
  is a pure single form of matter.
  As we look around, we can see that most
  of the matter around us exist as mixtures of
  two or more pure components, for example,
  sea water, minerals, soil etc. are all mixtures.<br>
  2.1 What is a Mixture?<br>
  Mixtures are constituted by more than one
  kind of pure form of matter. We know that
  dissolved sodium chloride can be separated
  from water by the physical process of
  evaporation. However, sodium chloride is itself
  a pure substance and cannot be separated by
  physical process into its chemical constituents.
  Similarly, sugar is a substance which contains
  only one kind of pure matter and its
  composition is the same throughout.
  Soft drink and soil are not single pure
  substances. Whatever the source of a
  pure substance may be, it will always have
  the same characteristic properties.
  Therefore, we can say that a mixture
  contains more than one pure substance.<br>
  2.1.1 TYPES OF MIXTURES<br>
  Depending upon the nature of the components
  that form a mixture, we can have different
  types of mixtures.<br><br>
  Activity ______________ 2.1
  •<br> Let us divide the class into groups A,
  B, C and D.
  • Group A takes a beaker containing
  50 mL of water and one spatula full of
  copper sulphate powder. Group B takes
  50 mL of water and two spatula full of
  copper sulphate powder in a beaker.
  • Groups C and D can take different
  amounts of copper sulphate and
  potassium permanganate or common
  salt (sodium chloride) and mix the given
  components to form a mixture.
  • Report the observations on the
  uniformity in colour and texture.
  • Groups A and B have obtained a
  mixture which has a uniform
  composition throughout. Such
  mixtures are called homogeneous
  mixtures or solutions. Some other
  examples of such mixtures are: <br>(i) salt
  dissolved in water and (ii) sugar
  How do we judge whether milk, ghee, butter,
  salt, spices, mineral water or juice that we
  buy from the market are pure?
